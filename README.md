# JSetUID
****
Sample code illustrating how to use native setuid function to allow applications to start as a privliged user, such as root, and later change to an unprivileged user. This project uses the [JNA-POSIX](http://kenai.com/projects/jna-posix) project to access the standard C library directly and so does not require compiling a separate native library.
